The Models for dwiki
===================

The models provide the storage and retreival of the pages and the books. This
will one day be broken up so the backend is plugable, but for now it is just a 
folder, which is stored in git.

    >>> from ns.dwiki import models
    >>> library = models.WikiLibrary('/tmp/mystore')
    >>> library.get_shelves()
    []
    
Create the shelf
    >>> new_shelf = models.WikiShelf(library, 'My Shelf')
    >>> new_shelf.get_books()
    []
    >>> library.get_shelves()
    ['My Shelf']

Books
    >>> new_book = models.WikiBook(new_shelf, 'My Book')
    >>> new_shelf.get_books()
    ['My Book']
    >>> new_book.get_pages()
    []

Creating a page is straight forward
    >>> new_page = models.WikiPage(new_book)
    >>> new_page.title = 'My title'
    >>> new_page.title
    'My title'
    >>> new_page.body = """
    ...   Some text
    ...  * Some more text
    ... """

Saving it requires a call to the store
    >>> new_page.save()
    >>> new_book.get_pages()
    ['My title']
    
Now we can retrieve the file
    >>> new_page2 = new_book.get_page('My title')
    >>> new_page2.title
    'My title'
    
We can rename the page
    >>> new_page2.title = 'My Title - new'
    >>> new_page2.save()
    >>> new_book.get_pages()
    ['My Title - new']

And finally DESTROY
    >>> for shelf in library.get_shelves():
    ...     shelf = library.get_shelf(shelf)
    ...     for book in shelf.get_books():
    ...         book = shelf.get_book(book)
    ...         for page in book.get_pages():
    ...             book.delete_page(page)
    ...         shelf.delete_book(book.name)
    ...     library.delete_shelf(shelf.name)
